## About the Router

The implementation of our Router is noted below

**Note: test.component.ts is just for demonstration usage and is configures to be on the root path --> '/'**

######Import statement in app.module.ts so we can use the module:
```typescript
**import { RouterModule } from '@angular/router';**
```

######RouterModule is included in the imports attribute in same file (app.module.ts):
```typescript
imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    FormsModule,
    HttpModule,
    **RouterModule.forRoot([
      { path: '', component: TestComponent },
      { path: '**', component: PageNotFoundComponent }
    ])**
  ],
```

######Router-outlet tag used in app.component.html, which is the root element's html:
```typescript
<h1>
  {{title}}
</h1>

<!-- Routed views goes here -->
**<router-outlet></router-outlet>**
```
